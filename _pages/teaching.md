# 2023
I mainly teach two modules at the [university of Rennes](https://istic.univ-rennes.fr/).

## Algorithmes et Complexité Expérimentales (ACE)
A course aimed at first years (L1 ISTN) about computational complexity, mainly taught in JAVA.
I gave a practical class, playing around with different basic algorithms to showcase how the complexity of an algorithm will influence real-time executions. The class consisted mostly of these practical sessions, in order to let the students play around with the algorithms and gain insight on what influences the complexity. 

## BAD - Bases de Données
A course aimed at second year (L2 ISTN) about databases.
