I'm a Ph.D student in Computer systems at [INRIA Rennes](https://team.inria.fr/wide/) in Brittany, France. 
I'm part of both the [WIDE](https://team.inria.fr/wide/) and [LACODAM](https://team.inria.fr/lacodam/) team.

I mainly focus on privacy concerns in decentralized federated learning. 
For now, I am mostly specializing in decentralized learning convergence proofs as well as privacy proofs.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
